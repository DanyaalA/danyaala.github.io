            <h2>Ansys Fluent CFD Analysis — Corning ProCulture 500mL Spinner Flask</h2>

                <img src="images/500mL-spinner.png" alt="500mL Spinner CFD" onerror="this.src='images/placeholder.svg'">
            </div>
            <div class="modal-details">
                <h3>What we were building (the point)</h3>
                <p>The goal was to characterise the internal shear environment of a Corning ProCulture 500mL disposable spinner flask used for aggregate-based cell culture, and to use that information to identify process parameters that produce equivalent shear profiles across scales (125mL, 500mL, 1L). This enabled scale-consistent culture of shear-sensitive cellular spheroids as part of a scalable bioprocess strategy at Aspect Biosystems.</p>

                <h3>Why it was hard</h3>
                <p>Spinner flasks with impellers produce highly localized regions of elevated shear and complex flow patterns. Capturing these correctly requires careful geometric representation of the impeller and realistic boundary conditions. The challenge was to predict peak shear regions that correlate with biological outcomes (spheroid viability and morphology) while keeping simulations computationally tractable for many scale comparisons. Empirical validation is required, so the CFD had to converge to physically realistic results, not just numerically stable solutions.</p>

                <h3>What I did (role and methods)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prepared CAD: Modeled the critical impeller geometry and internal vessel features in SolidWorks to accurately represent the real system.</li>
                    <li>Model simplification: Analysed the physical setup and justified simplifications — treated the system as single-phase (assumed minimal phase mixing) and steady-state for the purpose of mapping shear fields efficiently.</li>
                    <li>CFD setup: Built the fluid volume mesh and solver setup in Ansys Fluent. Selected turbulence models and solver settings appropriate for low-Re, impeller-driven flow and ran simulations to convergence (residual k &lt;= 1e-3).</li>
                    <li>Post-processing: Computed shear stress (dynamic viscosity × strain rate) and wall shear stress contours on planes and surfaces to localize maximum shear regions inside the vessel.</li>
                    <li>Scale testing: Used the validated 500mL model as a reference to run parameter sweeps at 125mL and 1L scales to determine operating points (impeller speed, fill volume) that reproduce the same shear profile.</li>
                    <li>Data analysis & validation: Correlated CFD-predicted peak shear with empirical observations from the lab; iterated boundary conditions and mesh until CFD predictions aligned with measured outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The CFD analysis successfully identified where peak shear occurs in the spinner flask and allowed rapid in-silico screening of scale-up parameters. Using the CFD-derived parameter sets, lab testing produced spheroid products with consistent morphology across 125mL, 500mL, and 1L scales, supporting a scale-consistent manufacturing strategy. The computational approach reduced the need for repeated full-scale experiments and accelerated the process development timeline.</p>

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mesh quality and geometric fidelity matter — small geometric details around the impeller significantly affect local shear predictions.</li>
                    <li>Appropriate simplifications (single-phase, steady-state) can be justified when validated against experiments, enabling many rapid parametric sweeps.</li>
                    <li>Close collaboration with experimentalists is essential: CFD is only useful when tied to measurable biological outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What I would do differently</h3>
                <p>With more compute budget and time, I would run transient multiphase simulations to capture any intermittent mixing or bubble entrainment effects and to predict time-varying shear exposures. I would also couple particle-based models for spheroid motion and deformation to more directly simulate biological stress. These additions would increase fidelity but at the cost of much longer compute time; therefore I used a pragmatic steady-state approach for rapid parameter exploration.</p>

                <h3>Why I didn't do that originally</h3>
                <p>The project required rapid iteration across many parameter combinations to identify scale-consistent operating windows. Transient multiphase or particle-coupled models are far more computationally expensive and would have prevented timely decision-making during the co-op. The steady-state single-phase model provided the right balance of predictive value and speed when validated against lab data.</p>

                <h3>What we were building (the point)</h3>
                <p>The goal was to experimentally determine how far 405&nbsp;nm light penetrates into a GelMA photocrosslinking hydrogel — an essential parameter for assessing whether a light‑cured implant could fully polymerize within a spinal cord injury site. A previous simulation predicted depth of cure; my task was to design and execute an experiment to validate (or challenge) those predictions using a controlled physical setup.</p>

                <h3>Why it was hard</h3>
                <p>Light propagation in hydrated biomaterials is complex: scattering, absorption, and refractive interfaces all influence photocrosslinking depth. Small geometric or optical artifacts — especially reflections or refraction from the substrate — can cause the apparent cured depth to deviate significantly from true in‑situ behaviour. Creating an experimental setup that isolated the gel’s intrinsic optical properties required careful control of stray light, elimination of indirect curing pathways, and a geometry that allowed precise sectioning of the cured column for visual analysis. Physically meaningful results relied on eliminating every unintended transmission path.</p>

                <h3>What I did (role and methods)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Experimental design:</strong> Built a controlled setup to expose a vertical GelMA column to 405&nbsp;nm light, enabling direct visual determination of cured vs uncured regions after sectioning.</li>
                    <li><strong>CAD &amp; prototyping:</strong> Designed SolidWorks master molds for PDMS jigs that cast a uniform cylindrical gel column. Iterated prototype geometries to minimise light leakage or refraction from the PDMS substrate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optical isolation:</strong> Designed and fabricated a light‑blocking shroud so only direct, axial illumination reached the gel — preventing PDMS‑induced refraction that could artificially inflate the observed cure depth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification method:</strong> Cured samples, manually sectioned the gel column, and visually identified the boundary between crosslinked and uncrosslinked layers for depth measurement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model refinement:</strong> Compared experimental results with the simulation; observed a consistent ~3× lower cured depth than predicted and recommended full optical characterisation (absorption, scattering, refractive index) of GelMA and PDMS to update the model parameters.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The experiment demonstrated a significant discrepancy — roughly a threefold overestimation — in the simulation’s predicted cure depth. This prompted a redesign of the optical model and provided the team with a clearer understanding of the constraints on photocuring within tissue‑like environments. The test jig and shroud designs now serve as reusable tools for subsequent characterisation experiments.</p>

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even simple curing experiments require rigorous optical control; substrate‑induced refraction can meaningfully distort results.</li>
                    <li>CAD iteration is essential for experimental fixtures — small geometric changes can drastically alter light paths.</li>
                    <li>Photopolymerisation behaviour depends heavily on material‑specific optical properties, not only intensity and exposure time.</li>
                    <li>Empirical validation is indispensable — simulations can be misleading without accurate material constants.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What I would do differently</h3>
                <p>With more time I would measure absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, and refractive index of both GelMA and PDMS to provide accurate optical inputs to the simulation. I would also incorporate quantitative analysis (optical microscopy or mechanical indentation) to obtain a precise numerical depth of cure rather than relying solely on visual inspection.</p>

                <h3>Why I didn’t do that originally</h3>
                <p>Time constraints limited deeper material characterisation. The priority was to quickly determine whether the existing simulation was directionally accurate. A rapid, well‑controlled empirical experiment provided the clarity needed to prompt simulation revision while keeping the project on schedule.</p>

                <h3>What we were building</h3>
                <p>As part of the UBC Mars Rover project, our science subteam developed an automated life‑detection module. A key piece was a microfluidic mixing chip that allowed cell viability assays with much smaller sample and reagent volumes, plus a custom fluorometer for readout.</p>

                <h3>Why it was hard</h3>
                <p>The microfluidic mixer needed to produce reliable, repeatable mixing at very low volumes while maintaining low shear for delicate biological samples. Matching flow regimes and pressure drops to achieve consistent assay conditions in a compact form factor was challenging. For the fluorometer, ensuring a noise‑free, stable LED excitation supply in a compact, battery‑powered instrument required careful analog design and PCB layout to prevent measurement artifacts.</p>

                <h3>What I did (role and methods)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microfluidic design: Designed a microfluidic mixing chip in Flui'idevice to rapidly evaluate flow regimes and pressure drops, iterated the geometry to minimize dead volume and ensure laminar mixing for assay consistency.</li>
                    <li>Prototyping: Manufactured chips using SLA printing and post-processing to validate fabrication tolerances and flow behavior.</li>
                    <li>Fluorometer excitation circuit: Designed the LED excitation circuit in Altium, adding a step‑down regulator and robust decoupling to provide a stable, low‑noise LED supply. Bench‑tested the circuit using perfboard/THT components before committing to PCB manufacturing.</li>
                    <li>Electronics integration: Implemented PCB design practices (component placement, ground planes, decoupling, and analog routing) to reduce EMI and maintain signal integrity in low‑light photodetection environments.</li>
                    <li>Systems integration and testing: Integrated microfluidic chips with the fluorometer and developed benchtop assays to validate viability readouts with reduced reagent volumes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The microfluidic mixer enabled cell viability assays with substantially reduced sample and reagent consumption, and the fluorometer excitation circuit delivered low‑noise illumination suitable for sensitive photometric reads. The combined system supported onboard assay prototyping and reduced resource requirements for field testing on the rover platform.</p>

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Early simulation in domain-specific tools (Flui'idevice) speeds up iteration for microfluidic geometries and prevents costly fabrication cycles.</li>
                    <li>Analog design fundamentals (decoupling, layout, and grounding) are critical for reliable optical measurement systems.</li>
                    <li>Prototyping on perfboard is valuable for validating circuit concepts before committing to PCB fabrication.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What I would do differently</h3>
                <p>Given more time I would run a co‑simulation that links microfluidic CFD/flow with the optical readout to better predict assay signal as a function of flow-induced shear and residence time. I would also add more formal EMC testing early in the PCB cycle to further reduce noise risk.</p>

                <h3>Additional assets</h3>
                <p>If you have more Rover photos, schematics, or Altium exports you can upload them and I will embed them here. (Note: the Mend the Gap video belongs to the spinal cord project — please upload that video and I will add it to the Mend the Gap modal.)</p>
