            <h2>Ansys Fluent CFD Analysis — Corning Proculture 500mL Spinner Flask</h2>
            <div class="modal-details">
                <p><strong>Confidentiality note:</strong> The image shown is a representative example based on publicly available geometry. Any CFD data or design details specific to my work at Aspect Biosystems have been excluded to maintain NDA compliance.</p>

                <p style="text-align:center;margin:0.5rem 0;"><img src="images/500mL-spinner.png" alt="Summarized CFD model" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" onerror="this.src='images/placeholder.svg'"></p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>The goal was to characterise the internal shear environment of a Corning ProCulture 500mL disposable spinner flask used for aggregate-based cell culture, and to use that information to identify process parameters that produce equivalent shear profiles across multiple scales. This enabled scale-consistent culture of shear-sensitive cellular spheroids as part of a scalable bioprocess strategy at Aspect Biosystems.</p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Stirred-tank reactors, particularly paddle impellers, produce highly localized regions of elevated shear and complex flow patterns. Capturing these correctly requires careful geometric representation of the impeller and realistic boundary conditions. The challenge was to predict peak shear regions that correlate with biological outcomes (spheroid viability and morphology) while keeping simulations computationally tractable for many scale comparisons. Empirical validation is required, so the CFD had to converge to physically realistic results, not just numerically stable solutions.</p>

                <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>This was a fully independent project conducted end-to-end, involving the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preparation of representative CAD:</strong> Identified and modeled the critical impeller geometry and internal vessel features in SolidWorks to accurately represent the geometry that drives shear generation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model simplification:</strong> Analysed the physical setup and justified simplifications — treated the system as single-phase (assumed minimal phase mixing) and steady-state for the purpose of mapping shear fields efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>CFD setup:</strong> Built the fluid volume mesh and solver setup in Ansys Fluent. Selected turbulence models and solver settings appropriate for high‑Re, impeller‑driven flow and ran simulations to convergence (residuals k &lt;= 1e-3).</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-processing:</strong> Computed shear stress (dynamic viscosity × strain rate) and wall shear stress contours on planes and surfaces to locate maximum shear regions inside the vessel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale testing:</strong> Modeled and simulated smaller scale systems in SolidWorks/Fluent to test process parameters and obtain similar shear profiles; designed and conducted wet lab experiments to validate simulation results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process documentation:</strong> Drafted descriptive protocols for use of Fluent to rapidly simulate stirred‑tank systems, ensuring knowledge transfer at the end of the engagement.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="float:right;max-width:40%;margin:0 0 1rem 1rem;"><img src="images/500mL-spinner.png" alt="CFD summary inset" style="width:100%;height:auto;" onerror="this.src='images/placeholder.svg'"></p>

                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The CFD analysis successfully identified where peak shear occurs in the spinner flask and allowed rapid in‑silico screening of scale‑up parameters. Using the CFD‑derived parameter sets, lab testing produced spheroid products with consistent morphology across multiple scales, supporting a scale‑consistent manufacturing strategy. The computational approach reduced the need for repeated full‑scale experiments and accelerated the process development timeline.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways and Learnings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Geometric simplifications matter. Modeling every detail adds complexity with marginal benefits after a certain point; focus on features that influence key parameters to speed iteration.</li>
                    <li>Mesh quality is critical — mesh convergence substantially improves shear prediction near the impeller.</li>
                    <li>Practical testing remains essential. Simplified models accelerate iteration but must be validated experimentally to refine parameters.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Potential improvements</h3>
                <p>Given the tight timeline, the model relied on significant geometric simplifications and a single‑phase approach. With more time, I would:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement a transient model to understand shear evolution during impeller start‑up and time‑varying behaviour.</li>
                    <li>Introduce two‑phase modeling to assess whether phase mixing meaningfully affects the physics of interest.</li>
                    <li>Conduct a full mesh‑independence study to quantify discretization error.</li>
                    <li>Evaluate alternative turbulence models (e.g., RSM or k‑ω SST variants) to study sensitivity and improve shear predictions.</li>
                    <li>Perform basic uncertainty quantification to evaluate robustness of the simulation.</li>

            <div class="modal-details">
                <h3>What we were building (the point)</h3>
                <p>The goal was to experimentally determine how far 405&nbsp;nm light penetrates into a GelMA photocrosslinking hydrogel — an essential parameter for assessing whether a light‑cured implant could fully polymerize within a spinal cord injury site. A previous simulation predicted depth of cure; my task was to design and execute an experiment to validate (or challenge) those predictions using a controlled physical setup.</p>

                <h3>Why it was hard</h3>
                <p>Light propagation in hydrated biomaterials is complex: scattering, absorption, and refractive interfaces all influence photocrosslinking depth. Small geometric or optical artifacts — especially reflections or refraction from the substrate — can cause the apparent cured depth to deviate significantly from true in‑situ behaviour. Creating an experimental setup that isolated the gel’s intrinsic optical properties required careful control of stray light, elimination of indirect curing pathways, and a geometry that allowed precise sectioning of the cured column for visual analysis. Physically meaningful results relied on eliminating every unintended transmission path.</p>

                <h3>What I did (role and methods)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Experimental design:</strong> Built a controlled setup to expose a vertical GelMA column to 405&nbsp;nm light, enabling direct visual determination of cured vs uncured regions after sectioning.</li>
                    <li><strong>CAD &amp; prototyping:</strong> Designed SolidWorks master molds for PDMS jigs that cast a uniform cylindrical gel column. Iterated prototype geometries to minimise light leakage or refraction from the PDMS substrate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optical isolation:</strong> Designed and fabricated a light‑blocking shroud so only direct, axial illumination reached the gel — preventing PDMS‑induced refraction that could artificially inflate the observed cure depth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verification method:</strong> Cured samples, manually sectioned the gel column, and visually identified the boundary between crosslinked and uncrosslinked layers for depth measurement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model refinement:</strong> Compared experimental results with the simulation; observed a consistent ~3× lower cured depth than predicted and recommended full optical characterisation (absorption, scattering, refractive index) of GelMA and PDMS to update the model parameters.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The experiment demonstrated a significant discrepancy — roughly a threefold overestimation — in the simulation’s predicted cure depth. This prompted a redesign of the optical model and provided the team with a clearer understanding of the constraints on photocuring within tissue‑like environments. The test jig and shroud designs now serve as reusable tools for subsequent characterisation experiments.</p>

                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Even simple curing experiments require rigorous optical control; substrate‑induced refraction can meaningfully distort results.</li>
                    <li>CAD iteration is essential for experimental fixtures — small geometric changes can drastically alter light paths.</li>
                    <li>Photopolymerisation behaviour depends heavily on material‑specific optical properties, not only intensity and exposure time.</li>
                    <li>Empirical validation is indispensable — simulations can be misleading without accurate material constants.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What I would do differently</h3>
                <p>With more time I would measure absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, and refractive index of both GelMA and PDMS to provide accurate optical inputs to the simulation. I would also incorporate quantitative analysis (optical microscopy or mechanical indentation) to obtain a precise numerical depth of cure rather than relying solely on visual inspection.</p>

                <h3>Why I didn’t do that originally</h3>
                <p>Time constraints limited deeper material characterisation. The priority was to quickly determine whether the existing simulation was directionally accurate. A rapid, well‑controlled empirical experiment provided the clarity needed to prompt simulation revision while keeping the project on schedule.</p>

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>On UBC Rover’s Science Subteam, we work to quantify the presence of life and habitability of Mars based on biomarker detection in soil samples. With historical methods relying on bulky onboard spectrophotometers and preloaded cuvettes, I designed microfluidic cartridges to perform encapsulated life‑detection assays. These chips are preloaded with lyophilized stains, contain a micromixer to combine the input sample and stain, and end in a viewing window which enables fluorometric analysis — all with less than 3 mL of sample and dye.</p>

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>The microfluidic chip needed to efficiently and repeatably mix samples and reagents within a minimal form factor while minimizing SLA resin usage for cost effectiveness. For the fluorometer, providing a noise‑free, stable power supply to the excitation LED in a noisy onboard power environment required careful analog circuit and PCB design.</p>

                <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CAD &amp; simulation:</strong> Designed and simulated fluid flow within the micromixer to ensure laminar flow and evaluate pressure drops; modeled the chip and support hardware in SolidWorks.</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>Work is ongoing, but the excitation LED circuit has been proven on bench and PCBs have been sent for manufacture. The microfluidic chip design is validated for 3D printing and optimized for material use; next steps include sensor integration and photodetector circuit development.</p>

                <h3>Takeaways and Learnings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design for manufacturability (DFM) is crucial: manufacturing constraints must inform early design choices.</li>
                    <li>Early, domain‑specific simulation accelerates iteration and reduces costly prototype cycles.</li>
                    <li>Analog design fundamentals (decoupling, layout, grounding) are essential for reliable optical measurement systems.</li>
                    <li>Prototyping on perfboard is valuable for validating circuit concepts before committing to PCB fabrication.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Future improvements</h3>
