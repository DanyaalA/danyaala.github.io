# Danyaal Abbas — Portfolio Website

This repository powers my personal website, where I showcase my engineering work, projects, and interests. The site reflects how I approach problem-solving as a cross-functional biomedical engineer — curious, hands-on, and focused on turning ideas into practical, working solutions.

## About the Site
The website is designed to be simple, fast, and easy to navigate. It includes:

- A short bio and personal introduction  
- Selected engineering and technical projects  
- Contact information and other relevant links  

## Tech Stack
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting  
- **HTML/CSS/JS/Python**
- Fully static, no build tools required  

To run locally, clone the repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Purpose
This site serves as:

- A centralized home for my work and experience  
- A clean landing page for applications, recruiters, and collaborators  
- A place to document ongoing projects and updates
